Given this similarity, why does a CSV file usually take less memory than a JSON formatted file for the same data? Under what conditions could a JSON file be smaller in memory than a CSV file for the same data? [10 points]\n"

    "A CSV usually takes less memory than a JSON since CSVS primarily rely on positional orders of data fields whereas JSON relies on key-value pairs. This means that the repeated key names significantly increase the file size. Finally, CSVs only use commas/ line breaks to separate the records but JSOn uses braces, square brackets, and additional deliminaters. The extra characters add to the file size and memory footprint. A JSON file would be smaller in memory than a CSV file for data that is tree based since CSV only accomodates tabular data. "

Take a moment and look at this JSON file in your web browser or with https://jsonhero.io. The structure of this particular JSON is complicated, but see if you can find the team-by-team data. In this problem our goal is to use `pd.json_normalize()` to get the data into a dataframe. The following questions will guide you towards this goal.\n",

    "Pull data in JSON format from Reddit's top 25 posts on [/r/popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/top/). Start by using `requests.get()` with the `headers=myheaders` argument on the website: http://www.reddit.com/r/popular/top.json. Then use `json.loads()` to parse the JSON format as python dictionaries and lists. If you look at the result, you should see JSON data. (If instead you see an access denied message, wait a couple minutes, restart your notebook and try again.)\n",

    "If you were to use `pd.json_normalize()` at this point, you would pull all of the features in the data into one dataframe, resulting in a dataframe with 172 columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we only wanted a few features, then looping across elements of the JSON list itself and extracting only the data we want may be a more efficient approach.\n",

    "Use looping - and not `pd.read_json()` or `pd.json_normalize()` - to create a dataframe with 25 rows (one for each of the top 25 posts), and only columns for `subreddit`, `title`, `ups`, and `created_utc`. You can follow the example listed in [section 3.3.3 of Surfing the Data Pipeline with Python](https://jkropko.github.io/surfing-the-data-pipeline/ch3.html#looping-across-records-to-extract-datapoints) as a way to start. (Your result might be a dataframe without any column headers. You can set the `.columns` attribute of the dataframe to the list `['subreddit', 'title', 'ups', 'created_utc']`.) [12 points]\n"
